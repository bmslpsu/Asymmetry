# Asymmetry

Analysis functions for Asymmetry project

## Intructions
1. Download folders "Experiment_Asymmetry" & "Experiment_Asymmetry_Control" from box.com
2. Edit main functions root folders to your folder location "...\Experiment_Asymmetry" and "...\Experiment_Asymmetry_Control"
3. Add all functions to path and run main functions

***NOTE: Analyze_Asymmetry_Control.m is not complete yet (do not run)
## Main Functions

* Analyze_Asymmetry.m

	*Analysis function for 45 deg/s random spatial frequency >>> WBA plots for CW & CCW motion (video and DAQ)*
	
* Analyze_Asymmetry_Control.m

	*Analysis function for 30-150 deg/s and all spatial frequencys >>> WBA plots for CW & CCW motion (DAQ only)*
	
## Supplementary Functions

* PlotPatch.m

	*Plots means with STD patch*

* hampel.m

	*Hampel filter*

* scatplot.m

	*Scatter plot with densities*
